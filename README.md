# Boltzmann
This is the beginning of a Boltzmann machine simulator. A number of sets of
software already exist to implement deep learning systems involving
feedforward networks for e.g. classification. Many of these are capable of
simulating restricted Boltzmann machines but are not built explicitly for
such use, particularly in the mode of operation typically associated with
Boltzmann machines, asynchronous stochastic update via the flipping
probability. So this implementation will focus specifically on these details.
